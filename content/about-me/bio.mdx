I am Muhammad Garuda, fulltime high school student and software engineer. I’ve been fascinated by technology since childhood. Began with simple curiosity like disassembling gadgets, experimenting with games, and teaching myself to code — grew into a passion for building tools that solve real problems.

By junior high school, all my passion opening me into professional sectors, giving me the rare opportunity to work in the tech industry at an early age. This experience confirmed what excites me most about technology: the challenge of connecting technical depth with human needs.
