I didn’t grow up wanting to work in tech.

As a kid, I liked figuring things out. Not in a “coding prodigy” way, more like helping my father fix small things at home, asking why something worked the way it did, and trying a few solutions until one finally clicked. That habit of problem-solving stayed with me.

Before code, visuals caught my attention. I enjoyed videos, photos, and simple editing. Not because I spent all my time on it, but because it let me experiment with ideas and emotions. That curiosity later showed up again, just in a different form.

When I wanted to properly learn coding, I picked Java. No big reason, I just wanted to understand how code works. Around the same time, I was deep into Minecraft. Running servers, tweaking configs, breaking things, fixing them again. I tried Roblox too. Lua felt overwhelming back then, so I dropped it and moved on. Trying, failing, adjusting became normal.

By the end of elementary school, design became my entry point into tech. I went deep into UI/UX and joined early-stage startups earlier than most people my age. In 8th grade, I got my first real client and ended up leading a small project. I wasn’t coding yet, mostly designing and coordinating, but it taught me how to manage pressure and responsibility.

In senior high school, that interest showed up more clearly in everyday life. I became a “Tech Specialist,” not running systems, but helping with small tech problems when needed. I was challenged to build an e-voting system for the student council, which pushed me to think beyond just making things work. During school events, I often helped as a visual operator and editor.

Around the same time, I also became a photographer for Bina Desa activities. Documenting real people, real places, and real impact gave me a different perspective. It reminded me that behind every system, interface, or product, there are humans with stories.

Over time, design started to feel limiting. I still loved it, but I wanted more control over what I was building. So I shifted gradually toward software engineering. Design didn’t disappear, it just became part of how I think and code became the main tool.

Now, I’m a senior high school student and software engineer, mostly working in the React ecosystem. I’m interested in finance, economics, and education, spaces where clarity and impact matter. UTBK Tracker is one example of how I approach building, starting from a real problem, shipping early, and improving it with feedback. More than any single project, I enjoy sharing, learning, and growing alongside other builders.

I’m still figuring things out, mostly by building things, breaking them, and learning out loud. Some ideas work, some fail quietly, and a few turn into something bigger than I expected. Right now, I’m wrapping up this chapter, getting ready for university, and putting myself in rooms where real problems exist. If there’s something messy, unfinished, or worth improving, that’s usually where you’ll find me 😁
