import CLink from "@/components/cLink";

I’m a full-time senior high school student who builds software for real users, mostly in the React ecosystem. I like working on products that are clean, scalable, and practical.

I’m especially interested in projects at the intersection of finance, economics, and education — places where tech can move the needle.
